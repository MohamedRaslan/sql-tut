## The Database Design Process

-   *Requirements analysis*
-   *Conceptual design*
-   *Logical design*

## The Entity Relationship Model


At a basic level, databases store information about distinct objects, or entities, and the associations, or relationships, between these entities
A popular approach to conceptual design uses the Entity Relationship (ER) model


# Database Normalization

**The first normal form (1NF) has the following goals**
>   - A single cell must not hold more than one value (atomicity)
>   - There must be a primary key for identification
>   - No duplicated rows or columns

So we need to :
-   Create a separate table for each set of related data.
-   Identify each set of related data with a primary key.
-   Eliminate repeating groups in individual tables.

**The goals of second normal form (2NF) are**
>   A table is said to be in 2NF if it meets the following criteria:
> - It’s already in 1NF
> - Has no partial dependency. That is, all non-key attributes are fully dependent on a primary key.

So we need to:
-   Create separate tables for sets of values that apply to multiple
    records.
-   Relate these tables with a foreign key.

**Third normal form (3NF) adds one more goal**
> A table to be in 3NF, it must:
> - Be in 2NF
> - Have no transitive partial dependency.

So we need to
-   Eliminate fields that do not depend on the key.
